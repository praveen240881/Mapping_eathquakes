# Mapping_Earthquakes
Used JavaScript's leaflet library along with the Mapbox API to create visualization of earthquake data from the U.S geological survery.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. To complete this project, we used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then added the data to a map. Our approach was to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. We used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Challenge Overview
Basil and Sadhana like how we created the earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana wanted to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they wanted to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and to see the data on a third map.
